                    <h2>Pikachu</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pikachu (/ˈpiːkətʃuː/ ⓘ; Japanese: ピカチュウ, Hepburn: Pikachū) is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and
                        Game Freak's Pokémon
                        media franchise, and the franchise's mascot. First introduced in the video games Pokémon Red and
                        Blue, it was created by
                        Atsuko Nishida at the request of lead designer Ken Sugimori, with the design finalized by
                        Sugimori. Since Pikachu's
                        debut, it has appeared in multiple games including Pokémon Go and the Pokémon Trading Card Game,
                        as well as various
                        merchandise. While Pikachu has been primarily voiced in media by Ikue Ōtani, other actors have
                        also voiced the character
                        including Kate Bristol, Ryan Reynolds, Kaiji Tang, Hidetoshi Nishijima, Tōru Ōkawa, and Koichi
                        Yamadera.

                        Classified as an Electric-type Pokémon, Pikachu is a large yellow mouse with a lightning
                        bolt-shaped tail, and red sacs
                        on its cheek which can generate large amounts of electricity. Originally designed to be the
                        first part of a three-stage
                        evolution line in Red and Blue, Pikachu evolves into Raichu through the use of a "Thunder Stone"
                        item, with Raichu
                        intended to be able to evolve into 'Gorochu'. However 'Gorochu' was removed due to cartridge
                        space concerns, and a
                        pre-evolution for Pikachu, Pichu, was later added in the sequel titles Pokémon Gold and Silver.

                        Pikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species, largely due
                        to its appearance in the
                        Pokémon anime television series as the companion of series protagonist Ash Ketchum. Pikachu has
                        been well received by
                        critics, with particular praise given for to its cute design, and it has been regarded as an
                        icon of both the Pokémon
                        franchise and Japanese pop culture as a whole.
